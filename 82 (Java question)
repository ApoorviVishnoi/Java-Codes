Q1. What are the differences between C++ and Java?

Ans - C++ is not platform-independent; the principle behind C++ programming is “write once, compile anywhere.”
In contrast, because the byte code generated by the Java compiler is platform-independent, it can run on any machine, Java programs are written once and run everywhere.
n the context of Compiler and Interpreter.
Java refers to a compiled and interpreted language. In contrast, C++ is only a compiled language.
In Java, the source code is the compiled output is a platform-independent byte code.
In C++, the source program is compiled into an object code that is further executed to produce an output.

Q2. List the features of the Java Programming language?
Ans - A few of the significant features of Java Programming Language are:

Easy: Java is a language that is considered easy to learn. One fundamental concept of OOP Java has a catch to understand.

Secured Feature: Java has a secured feature that helps develop a virus-free and tamper-free system for the users.

OOP: OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming language. OOP signifies that, in Java, everything is considered an object.

Independent Platform: Java is not compiled into a platform-specific machine; instead, it is compiled into platform-independent bytecode. This code is interpreted by the Virtual Machine on which the platform runs.
